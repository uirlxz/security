# Square multiplication 

Hey guys,this project is about the square multiplication algorithm using in RSA.

There are two algorithm to calculate m^n.The ordinary one is calculate m*m*m.....*m and I name this algorithm "ordinary.java", the other one is the square multiplication algorithm which I named "algorithm.java".

It just calculate the power to test and verify the effiency of the algorithm without testing something like "12345^67890 mod 31".

In this programme you can type any integer m and n to caculate m^n（like 2^100000000,may need 5min）, because I use BigInteger to define them. 

At last you will get the using time to compare with the ordinary method to calculate m^n.

I'm a green hand in programming and It's the first github project I upload.So........Let's study together.........
