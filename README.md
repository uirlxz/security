# Square multiplication 

Hey guys,this project is about the square multiplication algorithm using in RSA.

It just calculate the power to test and verify the effiency of the algorithm without testing something like "12345^67890 mod 31".

In this programme you can type any integer m and n to caculate m^n（like 2^100000000,may need 5min）, because I use BigInteger to define them. 

At last you will get the using time to compare with the ordinary method to calculate m^n.

I'm a green hand in programming and It's the first github project I upload.So, if you find bugs, tell me and I will revise them.
